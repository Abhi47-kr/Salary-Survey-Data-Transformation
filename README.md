## Tool

## The Cleaning Process

- Data Backup
  - After assessing the data in order to understand what needed to be done to take it from messy to clean, a copy of the dataset was made in order to have the original dataset in the 
    event of data loss during cleaning.

- Autofit Row Height and Autofit Column Width
  - Implemented autofitting of row height and column width to ensure optimal visibility and readability of data, enhancing user experience and facilitating efficient navigation within the dataset.
 
- Renaming Column Headers
  - Performed renaming of column headers to enhance clarity and usability, ensuring that headers are concise, descriptive, and intuitive for improved data interpretation and analysis.
